                  High-order Remap Miniapp


## Purpose

**Remhos** (REMap High-Order Solver) is a miniapp that solves the pure
advection equations that are used to perform discontinuous field interpolation
(remap) as part of the Eulerian phase in Arbitrary-Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)
simulations.

Remhos is based on the discretization method described in the following article:

...

The Remhos miniapp is part of the [CEED software suite](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/software),
a collection of software benchmarks, miniapps, libraries and APIs for
efficient exascale discretizations based on high-order finite element
and spectral element methods. See http://github.com/ceed for more
information and source code availability.

The CEED research is supported by the [Exascale Computing Project](https://exascaleproject.org/exascale-computing-project)
(17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy
organizations (Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security
Administration) responsible for the planning and preparation of a
[capable exascale ecosystem](https://exascaleproject.org/what-is-exascale),
including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering and early
testbed platforms, in support of the nationâ€™s exascale computing imperative.

## Verification of Results

To make sure the results are correct, we verify the final mass (`mass`) and
maximum value (`max`) for the runs listed below:

1.  `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-hexagon.mesh -p 0 -rs 2 -dt 0.01 -tf 10 -mt 2`
2.  `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-hexagon.mesh -p 0 -rs 2 -dt 0.01 -tf 10 -mt 4`
3.  `./remhos -m ./data/disc-nurbs.mesh -p 1 -rs 3 -dt 0.005 -tf 3 -mt 2`
4.  `./remhos -m ./data/disc-nurbs.mesh -p 1 -rs 3 -dt 0.005 -tf 3 -mt 4`
5.  `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-square.mesh -p 5 -rs 4 -dt 0.002 -o 2 -tf 0.8 -mt 2`
6.  `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-square.mesh -p 5 -rs 4 -dt 0.002 -o 2 -tf 0.8 -mt 4`
7.  `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-cube.mesh -p 0 -rs 1 -o 2 -dt 0.02 -tf 8 -mt 4`
8.  `./remhos -m ../mfem/data/ball-nurbs.mesh -p 1 -rs 1 -dt 0.01 -tf 3 -mt 4`
9.  `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-square.mesh -p 14 -rs 3 -dt 0.005 -tf 0.5 -mt 4`
10. `./remhos -m ./data/periodic-cube.mesh -p 10 -rs 1 -o 2 -dt 0.02 -tf 0.5 -mt 4`
